			 <p>I&rsquo;m currently listening to <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781585425525">The Now Habit</a> audiobook by Dr Neil Fiore. ðŸ“š</p>
<p>My main takeaway so far is the idea of replacing â€˜I have toâ€™ do [task] with â€˜I choose toâ€™ do [task].</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s something to do, and I&rsquo;ve agreed to do it, then that was a decision I made instead of facing the alternative. So just do it and stop whining, or make the decision not to, deal with the consequences and move on to the next thing.</p>
<p>Dr Fiore highlights that productive people are able to reduce the agitated energy of a huge pending task by focusing on what can be done now. No matter how small the step.</p>
<p>Perfectionism is another big cause of procrastination. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m certainly guilty of. Dr Fiore emphasised the importance of accepting you&rsquo;re human and that it&rsquo;s normal to make mistakes and for things not to go perfectly. He suggests not giving yourself impossible expectations as they can stop you from doing the things you want to do.</p>
<p>Sounds quite simple when you write it down like that, but it&rsquo;s much more difficult to put into action when you risk something going wrong.</p>
<p>For me the ongoing energy, mood and consequences of procrastination are worse than almost anything. It&rsquo;s something to fix.</p>
<p>Good listen so far, will keep going.</p>

			 <p>Watched a <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/classes/billy-collins-teaches-reading-and-writing-poetry">MasterClass</a> video with the poet <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/billy-collins">Billy Collins</a> about reading and writing poetry.</p>
<p>He made the point that it&rsquo;s easy for anybody to pretend to be serious but impossible to pretend to be funny. You are either funny or you aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Got me thinking about how so much B2B content could do with more humour and personality. Is your audience <em>really</em> so serious?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to pretend to be serious with a stern face and half-baked &lsquo;thought leadership&rsquo;, but it&rsquo;s much more difficult to put yourself out there with some personality and a sense of humour.</p>
<p>I think the world needs more of it. What an opportunity.</p>
<p>Collins highlighted that Chaucer and Shakespeare loved to throw in jokes all over the place, and then the romantic poets came along and tried to bring that to a close.</p>
<p>Keats and Wordsworth are great poets. But I would probably rather have a chat, and a couple of drinks, with Chaucer or Shakespeare. When technology allows, of course.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole world of B2B content where jokes and puns are frowned upon. You may feel the need to be serious to get your content signed off. Yes, humour has its place, but why not expand it where we can?</p>
<p>And the punchline? Well, just watch this post gain hardly any traction and imagine my expression as I realise where I&rsquo;ve been going wrong.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m currently <a href="https://www.olisharman.com/reading/">rereading</a> <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780812985719">Dreyer&rsquo;s English</a> to brush up on some American grammar and enjoy the excellent prose of a man so in love with the craft of writing.</p>
<p>While chatting about this book on a call with somebody this morning, the conversation turned to hyphens and dashes.</p>
<p>Lots of people don&rsquo;t give much thought to the fact that em dashes (â€”), en dashes (â€“) and hyphens (-) all have different lengths and should be used for <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/em-dash-en-dash-how-to-use">different purposes</a>.</p>
<p>Hands up if you&rsquo;re guilty of reaching too quickly for the hyphen.</p>

<p>Well worth the time. Being sceptical of the information we get is perhaps more important than ever. About two billion people are voting this year in a world where AI makes it easy to facilitate misinformation and disinformation on a massive scale.</p>

			 <p>My career has not exactly been a straight path.</p>
<p>I have no regrets about that, I much prefer it that way.</p>
<p>But itâ€™s funny, because looking back at some of the moves Iâ€™ve made, itâ€™s easy to think at first glance that many of them went in the opposite direction to where I ended up landing.</p>
<p>Now I can see that what felt at the time like huge shifts ended up getting tangled back up with the skills and the experiences I gained earlier.</p>
<p>For example, my time working as a nurse in a hospital emergency department certainly helped me keep my cool when facing other types of emergencies from the comfort of my office desk.</p>
<h3 id="distance-adds-perspective">Distance adds perspective</h3>
<p>Iâ€™m writing this blog from rural southern Italy. Itâ€™s an environment quite different from the London suburb where I grew up.</p>
<p>The slower pace of life down here has allowed me to think. Iâ€™m talking about the type of thinking that I rarely had time for when living in London with a head full of worries and a train to catch.</p>
<p>As the local church bells chime every hour with what feels like increasing frequency, I realise that 2024 is just around the corner and Iâ€™m in danger of being left behind as time moves on.</p>
<h3 id="taking-pride-in-good-work">Taking pride in good work</h3>
<p>One of the things I notice about many of the Italians I meet is the pride they take in their work.</p>
<p>Here in Puglia, Iâ€™m fortunate to be surrounded by some fantastic craftspeople. Many of them are using skills that have been passed down in their families for generations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When buying a leather belt, itâ€™s possible to go to a workshop and meet the person who created it with their own hands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When buying a pizza, the kitchen is on display and you can watch the pizzaiolo flip the dough, place the toppings and manage the busy logistics of the oven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When buying mozzarella, you can go to a local farm to see the cows that gave the milk and the person who created the cheese that very morning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this got me thinking about where I stand. What do I build? What can I take pride in contributing to the world?</p>
<p>This led to a big change a few months back in my freelance business when I decided to focus more on email marketing. When done right emails have a huge positive impact on the people sending them as well as the people receiving them.</p>
<p>But working with all of this email design and code, coupled with the bruises Iâ€™ve gained from my battles with WYSIWYG website builders, made me realise Iâ€™m looking for something important.</p>
<h3 id="digital-craftsmanship">Digital craftsmanship</h3>
<p>This post is a public commitment to studying web development with the approach of a craftsman.</p>
<p>I mean, thereâ€™s no turning back now itâ€™s here and youâ€™ve read it, right?</p>
<p>This is not so much a pursuit of a new career or a complete change of direction, although I do not rule anything out.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m going to try to become a digital craftsman who can build websites Iâ€™m proud of and document some of the things I learn. In fact, the idea of sharing as I learn is one of the main drivers behind starting this blog and trying to form a new habit.</p>
<p>Who knows how all of this could tangle itself up with the past to lead me to somewhere Iâ€™d love to be? I donâ€™t know what that place looks like yet but if I sit still Iâ€™ll never find out.</p>
