			 <p>Great quote from Hunter S. Thompson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is not necessary to accept the choices handed down to you by life as you know it. There is more to it than that — no one HAS to do something he doesn&rsquo;t want to do for the rest of his life. But then again, if that&rsquo;s what you wind up doing, by all means convince yourself that you HAD to do it. You&rsquo;ll have lots of company.”</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Some useful definitions of diction, tone and voice from Mary Oliver’s <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780547543901">A Poetry Handbook</a>.</p>
<p>Diction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“&lsquo;Watch your language!&rsquo; you may say to someone who has just expressed himself with the help of slang or an expletive. What you really mean is &lsquo;Watch your diction!&rsquo; <em>Diction</em> means word choice.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The overall effect of the diction of a piece of writing, in addition to other elements, such as choice of subject, imagery, design of the poem, etc., is called <em>tone</em>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Voice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The term <em>voice</em> is used to identify the agency or agent who is speaking through the poem, apart from those passages that are actual dialogue. This voice, or speaker of the poem, is often called the <em>persona</em>.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781998991105">A Path Through the Jungle</a> by Prof Steve Peters 📚</p>
<p>What a fantastic book. Strongly recommend it to anybody looking for some practical, step-by-step advice for taking more control of your mind.</p>
<p>A quote that hit home:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Every day that we get up, we change. We are a different person from the one who went to bed the night before. By making small changes to your thinking and behaviours, over time, you will move yourself in the direction that you want to go.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems like solid advice too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, life seems more like a circus than a jungle. If you see life as a circus then stay in your seat and laugh at the clowns; don’t enter the ring and risk becoming one.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>As the dust settles on the US election result, those who care about what it means for the climate may find some strength in these words from James Stockdale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end — which you can never afford to lose — with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was a U.S. prisoner tortured and held captive for over seven years during the Vietnam War. It is known as the Stockdale Paradox.</p>
<p>Keep faith in the future but confront reality head on. Mix <a href="https://www.outrageandoptimism.org">outrage and optimism</a>.</p>

			 <p>Sir Jonathan Bate has commented on the <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/bb4aa9b1-f9df-427e-8e87-31385ff1d0d0?shareToken=108e7cdc1d5f9fbc0922b8dd9966b8d8">shift from humanities to STEM subjects</a> among students seeking well-paying jobs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The irony of that, of course, is that if you speak to employers, they really like English students because the best of them can write, communicate and think critically. The deeper irony is, with the AI revolution, the people who are really going to lose their jobs are the computer programmers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has a point. But in my opinion, what we need more of is writers who can code and coders who can write. I think AI can really help people expand their skillset.</p>
<p>As reliance on AI grows, those who develop deep, ‘analogue’ expertise in whatever it is they specialise in will stand head and shoulders above the rest.</p>
<p>I think how AI is used in education is particularly important. Especially if the machines break or get turned off one day.</p>

			 <p>Every now and then something happens in my life that reminds me of the importance of having a compassionate mind, both towards others and towards myself.</p>
<p>For example, a stranger was quite rude to me the other day. It was completely unprovoked, surprising and caught me off guard.</p>
<p>Instead of turning to anger or losing confidence, I thanked them and understood that their life may not be where they want it to be. And I was just some person who for whatever reason got in their way as they tried to keep going.</p>
<p>What may have once developed into a confrontation or knocked my confidence ended up as this blog post and a chance to reflect on how much I’ve grown.</p>

			 <p>Big fan of <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>. Its measured approach to incorporating AI in its writing tool is interesting.</p>

<p>Instead of adding OpenAI &amp; Co. to our app like everybody else, we figured that visually separating artificial and human text was the kind of problem we had to solve. So we did.</p>

			 <p>Great article by Helen Thomson in The Observer about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/06/best-walk-hike-for-mental-health-uk">mental health benefits of taking walks in nature</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout the pandemic, I tried to take a long walk in the countryside every day. Doing this helped me get through a difficult time, that’s for sure, but I didn’t really give much thought as to why. The article explains some good reasons I can relate to.</p>
<p>Although it may sound great to people living in cooler parts of the world planning a summer holiday, one of the main downsides of living in southern Italy is how unbearably hot the summers are. Walking, and being outside in general, feels impossible for much of the day.</p>
<p>Now summer is finally over and the temperature is more manageable, I want to explore more of the Puglia countryside.</p>
<p>As the title of the article says: “Nature is free, and the best kind of medicine”.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for a markdown editor that&rsquo;s nice to use, keeps everything in sync and plays well offline.</p>
<p>I frequently work across macOS, iOS and Linux. The fact I use Linux on my old Surface Pro when out and about throws a spanner in the works and narrows my options somewhat.</p>
<p>Decided to give <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> a spin.</p>
<p>Liking what I see so far, especially the option for making subheadings foldable in the editor. Very tidy. The general look and feel of the app is great too. Obsidian Sync works well and comes with a one month version history and activity log.</p>
<p>It also offers a welcome nudge to finally set up that <a href="https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes#zettelkasten-en">Zettelkasten</a> and figure out a more effective way of taking and managing notes. But that&rsquo;s for another day.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been comparing Google&rsquo;s Gemini 1.5 Pro with OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT-4o.</p>
<p>The consensus from my research seems to be that most people think that ChatGPT is by far the better product. However, I find Gemini offers a better experience for me.</p>
<p>I use it to help with lesson planning, learning Italian, studying iOS development and for help across other more general things. It&rsquo;s also become a new first point of call for much of what I would otherwise just Google the old-school way.</p>
<p>More often than not, Gemini reads between the lines to tell me what I need to know in a far better format and tone than what I get out of ChatGPT. It&rsquo;s also more frequently correct, with a button to link to sources if I want to dig deeper.</p>
<p>I find it much easier to be sloppy with my prompts and get what I need with Google than with ChatGPT. Sure that may make me sound lazy, but sometimes I don&rsquo;t particularly feel like &lsquo;engineering&rsquo; a prompt. This is not to say the difference is night and day, they are both very close, but I picked up on some nuances after using both for months as I weighed up where to spend my €23 per month.</p>
<p>There is something about Google that seems just nicer and clearer in the way it explains things. It&rsquo;s a bit less bland and cliché. The way information is structured and communicated matters a lot. There are so many different ways to say the same thing, with just as much variation in clarity and impact.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use it for any writing, however. Even for feedback as an editor, I find its language suggestions and structural ideas a bit too formulaic. But for research? If you&rsquo;re willing to treat it like a really smart academic who is known to be a serial liar and take drugs at any time of the day, I think it&rsquo;s a fantastic tool in your arsenal.</p>
<p>I often access Gemini through the Google app on my iPhone. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the format, there are two big tabs at the top: Search and Gemini. I would say that I use Gemini more often than Search.</p>
<p>I think this is a sign of things to come.</p>

			 <p>This quote from software engineer Kent Beck pretty much sums up where I keep going wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“By far the dominant reason for not releasing sooner was a reluctance to trade the dream of success for the reality of feedback.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dreams of future success may be a comfortable place to hang out, but they’re a complete waste of time.</p>
<p>Finish the work. Put it out there. Listen to what other people think about it.</p>

			 <p>It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you just are who you are, forgetting the power you have to take action and become who you want to be.</p>

<p>Keep taking those steps, no matter how tiny they may feel. They all add up if you just show up and keep moving.</p>

			 <p>Apple recently shared a great <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=5mcfho5g">Q&amp;A with its UX writing team</a> from last year&rsquo;s WWDC.</p>
<p>Lots of good insights here. If you&rsquo;re a writer it’s worth checking out the article in full, but I want to share their advice for explaining technical concepts in simple terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, remember that not everyone will have your level of understanding. Sometimes we get so excited about technical details that we forget the folks who might be using an app for the first time.</p>
<p>Try explaining the concept to a friend or colleague first — or ask an engineer to give you a quick summary of a feature.</p>
<p>From there, break down your idea into smaller components and delete anything that isn’t absolutely necessary. Technical concepts can feel even more intimidating when delivered in a big block of text. Can you link to a support page? Do people need that information in this particular moment? Offering small bits of information is always a good first step.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This ‘delete anything that isn’t absolutely necessary’ applies to more than just good UX writing. It’s also solid advice for marketing copy, especially when talking to a broad audience about technical products. It&rsquo;s so easy for readers to get lost and just give up on figuring out what you’re trying to say.</p>
<p>As they go on to say: &ldquo;Clarity should always be the priority&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>Interesting to hear Malcolm Gladwell talk about his writing process on <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/classes/malcolm-gladwell-teaches-writing">MasterClass</a>.</p>
<p>He shared how he breaks every piece of writing down into small, numbered sections before stringing it all together and figuring out what goes where and working on transitions. He didn&rsquo;t mean sections like chapters in a book or even subheadings in an article, he suggested that his sections are often far more granular than that.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty basic. But this approach makes large, intimidating projects easier to handle. It also helps build a feeling of ongoing momentum. I do something similar but without the numbers. Think I&rsquo;ll give the numbers a go.</p>

			 <p>Can’t remember how I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a> web development curriculum, but I’m glad I did.</p>
<p>I like the way it points you where to go to dig deeper into the topics, and it offers a nice blend of different learning materials and assignments.</p>
<p>I find it way easier to learn new things by reading about them instead of watching videos. Pissed that it’s taken me so long to figure that out. I think this is one of the main reasons why I’m having more success with this course compared to other ones I’ve tried in the past.</p>
<p>Need to decide whether to progress to Ruby on Rails or full stack JavaScript. I guess sticking with JavaScript should offer a deeper knowledge of the language but I heard that Ruby is a joy and Rails makes it easy to do a lot on your own.</p>
<p>I find myself at a fork in the road, and my research is all getting a bit <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken">Robert Frost</a>, but I’m trying not to take too much time mulling it over. To borrow a phrase from <a href="https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/february-1-2024">James Clear&rsquo;s newsletter</a> today, I think this decision is more of a hat than a haircut or a tattoo.</p>

			 <p>In a chapter in <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781982180607">Baseball 100</a> about Japanese baseball player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadaharu_Oh">Sadaharu Oh</a>, Joe Posnanski compares baseball training in Japan to spring training in the United States.</p>
<p>Training is much more gruelling in Japan apparently. He explains how, culturally, the sport is just viewed differently there.</p>
<p>When American manager Trey Hillman managed a Japanese team and tried to make some training sessions less intense, in an apparent effort to do the players a favour, the players weren&rsquo;t happy about it. For them, there was honour in putting in an extreme level of hard work that was just part of their sport.</p>
<p>Got me thinking about my approach to studying web development. Web development training, if you like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often banging my head against a wall trying to understand new things. It&rsquo;s tempting to look for shortcuts, AI assistance and other ways just to speed things up.</p>
<p>I hope that putting in the time and work to more fully learn and understand things will help me build a solid foundation on my path to <a href="https://www.olisharman.com/2023/12/31/becoming-a-digital.html">digital craftsmanship</a>.

			 <p>I&rsquo;m currently listening to <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781585425525">The Now Habit</a> audiobook by Dr Neil Fiore. 📚</p>
<p>It’s about beating procrastination. My main takeaway so far is the idea of replacing ‘I have to’ do [task] with ‘I choose to’ do [task].</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s something to do, and I&rsquo;ve agreed to do it, then that was a decision I made instead of facing the alternative. So just do it and stop whining, or make the decision not to, deal with the consequences and move on to the next thing.</p>
<p>Dr Fiore highlights that productive people are able to reduce the agitated energy of a huge pending task by focusing on what can be done now. No matter how small the step.</p>
<p>Perfectionism is another big cause of procrastination. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m certainly guilty of. Dr Fiore emphasised the importance of accepting you&rsquo;re human and that it&rsquo;s normal to make mistakes and for things not to go perfectly. He suggests not giving yourself big expectations as this can stop you from doing the things you need to do.</p>
<p>Sounds quite simple when you write it down like that, but it&rsquo;s much more difficult to put into action when you risk something going wrong.</p>
<p>For me the ongoing energy, mood and consequences of procrastination are worse than almost anything. It&rsquo;s something to fix.</p>
<p>Good listen so far, will keep going.</p>

			 <p>My career has not exactly been a straight path.</p>
<p>I have no regrets about that, I much prefer it that way.</p>
<p>But it’s funny, because looking back at some of the moves I’ve made, it’s easy to think at first glance that many of them went in the opposite direction to where I ended up landing.</p>
<p>Now I can see that what felt at the time like huge shifts ended up getting tangled back up with the skills and the experiences I gained earlier.</p>
<p>For example, my time working as a nurse in a hospital emergency department certainly helped me keep my cool when facing other types of emergencies from the comfort of my office desk.</p>
<h3 id="distance-adds-perspective">Distance adds perspective</h3>
<p>I’m writing this blog from rural southern Italy. It’s an environment quite different from the London suburb where I grew up.</p>
<p>The slower pace of life down here has allowed me to think. I’m talking about the type of thinking that I rarely had time for when living in London with a head full of worries and a train to catch.</p>
<p>As the local church bells chime every hour with what feels like increasing frequency, I realise that 2024 is just around the corner and I’m in danger of being left behind as time moves on.</p>
<h3 id="taking-pride-in-good-work">Taking pride in good work</h3>
<p>One of the things I notice about many of the Italians I meet is the pride they take in their work.</p>
<p>Here in Puglia, I’m fortunate to be surrounded by some fantastic craftspeople. Many of them are using skills that have been passed down in their families for generations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When buying a leather belt, it’s possible to go to a workshop and meet the person who created it with their own hands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When buying a pizza, the kitchen is on display and you can watch the pizzaiolo flip the dough, place the toppings and manage the busy logistics of the oven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When buying mozzarella, you can go to a local farm to see the cows that gave the milk and the person who created the cheese that very morning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this got me thinking about where I stand. What do I build? What can I take pride in contributing to the world?</p>
<p>This led to a big change a few months back in my freelance business when I decided to focus more on email marketing. When done right emails have a huge positive impact on the people sending them as well as the people receiving them.</p>
<p>But working with all of this email design and code, coupled with the bruises I’ve gained from my battles with WYSIWYG website builders, made me realise I’m looking for something important.</p>
<h3 id="digital-craftsmanship">Digital craftsmanship</h3>
<p>This post is a public commitment to studying web development with the approach of a craftsman.</p>
<p>I mean, there’s no turning back now it’s here and you’ve read it, right?</p>
<p>This is not so much a pursuit of a new career or a complete change of direction, although I do not rule anything out.</p>
<p>I’m going to try to become a digital craftsman who can build websites I’m proud of and document some of the things I learn. In fact, the idea of sharing as I learn is one of the main drivers behind starting this blog and trying to form a new habit.</p>
<p>Who knows how all of this could tangle itself up with the past to lead me to somewhere I’d love to be? I don’t know what that place looks like yet but if I sit still I’ll never find out.</p>
