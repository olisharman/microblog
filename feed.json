Pissed that it‚Äôs taken me so long to figure that out. I think this is one of the main reasons why I‚Äôm having more success with this course compared to other ones I‚Äôve tried in the past.\n\nNeed to decide whether to progress to Ruby on Rails or full stack JavaScript.

What do I build? What can I take pride in contributing to the world?\n\nThis led to a big change a few months back in my freelance business when I decided to focus more on email marketing. When done right emails have a huge positive impact on the people sending them as well as the people receiving them.\n\nBut working with all of this email design and code, coupled with the bruises I‚Äôve gained from my battles with WYSIWYG website builders, made me realise I‚Äôm looking for something important.\n\n### Digital craftsmanship\n\nThis post is a public commitment to studying web development with the approach of a craftsman.\n\nI mean, there‚Äôs no turning back now it‚Äôs here and you‚Äôve read it, right?\n\nThis is not so much a pursuit of a new career or a complete change of direction, although I do not rule anything out.\n\nI‚Äôm going to try to become a digital craftsman who can build websites I‚Äôm proud of and document some of the things I learn. In fact, the idea of sharing as I learn is one of the main drivers behind starting this blog and trying to form a new habit.\n\nWho knows how all of this could tangle itself up with the past to lead me to somewhere I‚Äôd love to be? I don‚Äôt know what that place looks like yet but if I sit still I‚Äôll never find out.\n",
